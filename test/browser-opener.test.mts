// az-iar/ao-pi#10: the approval flow shells out to xdg-open, so a suite run used to
// launch a real browser - hundreds of stray firefox processes on the host after a
// few runs. The guard is read at the boundary, and these tests are what keep it
// honest: a fake xdg-open on PATH records any launch, so the first case fails if a
// real one is attempted, and the second proves the recorder works so the first
// cannot pass by never being reached.
//
// They call openBrowser directly rather than running an approval: the flow spawns
// detached processes and holds a callback server, which is how the previous attempt
// at this test hung for its whole timeout instead of asserting anything.

// A PATH entry whose xdg-open records that it ran, instead of opening anything.
